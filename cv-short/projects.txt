- I have been developing games on Rōblox from 2013, having had an account since 2008.
  - At the time, the company was a small Silicon-Valley start-up.
  - Over the years, its developer-friendly tools led me to take up my current-day career as a programmer.
- From 2023, I've built a full-stack application for users to <i>host</i> and <i>join</i> self-hosted, historic versions of Rōblox in a local- or wide-area network.
  - Created a Python bootstrapper, dually for <choice>clients|end users</choice> and <choice>servers|custom backends|custom back-ends</choice>, for seamless connectivity
- Enhanced functionality through team collaboration, code reviews, and feature development.
- Evaluated fair-use compliance by auditing business-legal literature.

Bring Back Buffets

- During the Covid lockdowns, I engineered a mobile web app to revive buffets whilst minimising inflection risk.
- This project's user-interaction model drew inspiration from how some Korean barbecue establishments operate:
  - Where dine-in customers can order food directly from a website they can access from their phones.
- I built separate user interfaces for customers, cashiers, and back-of-house staff, with step-by-step documentation for setup.
- Although the project is fully developed, I was unable to secure clients.
