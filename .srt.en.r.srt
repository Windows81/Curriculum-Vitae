calculator but think of all the things

227
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,589
can't multiply two numbers as fast as a
calculator but think of all the things

can't multiply two numbers as fast as a

229
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,630
a high-end computer and look maybe you
can't multiply two numbers as fast as a

230
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:43,640
a high-end computer and look maybe you

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,610
million and 20 million times faster than
a high-end computer and look maybe you

million and 20 million times faster than

233
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,189
that means a human brain is between 2
million and 20 million times faster than

234
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:48,199
that means a human brain is between 2

235
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,589

100 quadrillion calculations per second
that means a human brain is between 2

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
can process between 10 quadrillion and

239
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,449
second that's a lot but the human brain
can process between 10 quadrillion and

240
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:55,459
second that's a lot but the human brain

241
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,089
processes about 5 billion operations per
second that's a lot but the human brain

processes about 5 billion operations per

243
