To render this résumé in PDF format, I use the nearest Chromium browser's headless mode.

You'll need:

- Python 3
  - The [get-chrome-paths module](https://github.com/Windows81/Get-Chrome-Paths)
- A Chromium-based browser that's easy to find
- A Bash-like shell to run [`_.sh`](_.sh)

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Windows81/sqlite-worker.git@main
```
