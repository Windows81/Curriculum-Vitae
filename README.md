# VisualPlugin's Cirriculum Vit√¶

The `_src` directory contains OpenDocument folder which get zipped to each form an `odt` archive. This format is natively compatibile with Word and can easily be edited programmatically.

7zip and Word are required to run the `patch.py` script.

Inside `_src`:

- The subdirectory `ats` contains an applicant-tracking-system-friendly formatting template.
- The subdirectory `cv` is for my more traditional template.

Top-level directories whose names are fully numerical correspond to LinkedIn job postings.

I'd like to give a shout-out to Daniel A. Quinonez for taking the time to review my CV! I should also thank ChatGPT for later revisions.
