-
- <b>Salient Moment:</b> I identified and took the initiative to solve issues which were outside my purview.
  - During a meeting, I overheard that the researchers were facing challenges in accessing a specific data structure obscured by dependency code, which blocked their analysis.
  - I located the data structure in a <code>private</code> variable buried in a library class.
  - To add some spice, I drafted a digital illustration showing the variable's name and presented that to the group.
  - However, my solution was not actionable as it required changes to the dependency code and overlooked other project needs.
