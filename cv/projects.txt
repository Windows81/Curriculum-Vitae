July 2023 thru now
Rōblox Freedom Distribution
<a href="https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution">https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution</a>
- I have been developing games on Rōblox from 2013, having had an account since 2008.
  - At the time, the company was a small Silicon-Valley start-up.
  - Over the years, its developer-friendly tools led me to take up my current-day career as a programmer.
- From 2023, I've built a <choice>full-stack|scalable</choice> application for users to <i>host</i> and <i>join</i> self-hosted, historic versions of Rōblox in a local- or wide-area network.
  - Created a Python bootstrapper, dually for <choice>clients|end users</choice> and <choice>servers|custom backends</choice>, for seamless connectivity.
- Enhanced functionality through team collaboration, code reviews, and feature development.
- Evaluated fair-use compliance by auditing business-legal literature, publicly disclosing analysis of legal risks and benefits of various intended use cases.

Sep 2023 thru Mar 2024
<choice>Front-end|Frontend</choice> Developer at GameIn
— Before graduating from UC Irvine, I took a capstone course where I collaborated, among classmates, with one of a choice of several companies.
- Owing to my prior experience in videogame development, I chose to work with GameIn, who were building a tool to match e-sports streamers and paying sponsors.
- Implemented <choice>mobile-responsive|mobile-user‑friendly</choice> pages<choice> using|; leveraged</choice> Next.js (and thus React) from mockups that we also made.
- Arranged, as part of a team, a slide deck with stylistic help from Figma.
  - The slide deck was presented to an audience of approx. 50 other students and their families.

March & April 2021
Bring Back Buffets
<a href="https://github.com/Windows81/Bring-Back-Buffets">https://github.com/Windows81/Bring-Back-Buffets</a>
- During the Covid lockdowns, I engineered a mobile web app to revive buffets whilst minimising inflection risk.
- This project's user-interaction model drew inspiration from how some Korean barbecue establishments operate:
  - Where dine-in customers can order food directly from a website they can access from their phones.
- I built separate user interfaces for customers, cashiers, and back-of-house staff, with step-by-step documentation for setup.
- Although the project is fully developed, I was unable to secure clients.

Dec 2019 thru Nov 2020
GoAnimate Wrapper
<a href="https://github.com/GoAnimate-Wrapper/GoAnimate-Wrapper">https://github.com/GoAnimate-Wrapper/GoAnimate-Wrapper</a>
- Using GoAnimate's <i>Legacy Video Maker</i>, I animated some engaging videos on my YouTube channel, often satirising trends set forth by other publishers who use the same tool.
  - However, it needed a remote server for file persistence and access to crucial assets, which was being discontinued after 2019.
  - A newer version of the program existed, but lacked crucial animation assets and effects.
- GoAnimate Wrapper is a server-backend application designed to interop with Vyond's Legacy Video Maker.
  - Reverse-engineered Flash files and analysed legacy ActionScript code.
  - Created and scaled a modern <choice>Node.js|JavaScript</choice> interface replicating GoAnimate's back-end functionalities.
- With a team of experts managing the community up to this day, Wrapper became my most popular application.
- Because of the need that it filled, my tool delivered hundreds of engaging video experiences.
  - By May 2021, over 21,000 results would appear on a YouTube query for Wrapper and its successors.

July 2022 thru May 2023
Rōblox Script Executor
<a href="https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Script-Executor-CLI">https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Script-Executor-CLI</a>
was a command-line interface facilitating script execution on Rōblox.
- Constructed custom syntax for script execution in Luau.
- Introduced per-script parameterization for user ease.
- Created 142 predefined scripts in a sister repository, many with help pages.

Dec 2022
"Screwdja YuJa"
<a href="https://github.com/Windows81/Screwdja-YuJa">https://github.com/Windows81/Screwdja-YuJa</a>
- I discovered and disclosed a severe vulnerability in YuJa's API.
- Over 6,000,000 academic videos, including private recordings of students taking proctored exams, were exposed on the open net.
- After sending the initial message, I was put directly in touch with the Chief Business Officer.
- YuJa released a security patch after ~2 days, closing the loop-hole for good.

Feb 2018 thru Sep 2019
Webhooky
<a href="https://github.com/Windows81/Playing-Webhooky">https://github.com/Windows81/Playing-Webhooky</a>
- Discord's webhook API allows developers to easily send custom messages from live Rōblox games to a shared space on Discord, where data persistence is more accessible than on Rōblox's servers.
- In 2018, when Discord abruptly blocked all webhook activity from Rōblox servers, I built a lightweight proxy to suit that need.
  - Made use of PHP, SQL (MySQL), and PHPMyAdmin to process and store request logs.
- Served over 200 distinct games, including from major studios such as ROLVe.
- Monitored and tracked infrastructure usage stats on cPanel via 000webhost, avoiding excessive downtime.

Tubeup
  - I use a variety of tools, most of which I install from GitHub, to automate tasks that would otherwise take me months to complete.
  - However, some of these tools are missing features or contain bugs which are trivial to fix.
-
<a href="https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup">https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup</a>
- Tubeup is a Python utility with 478 stars and new versions being released as of Feburary 2026.
  - It uses the <code>yt-dlp</code> and <code>internetarchive</code> libraries to download videos from YouTube to re-upload to the Internet Archive.
  - I discovered Tubeup in 2023 to help mitigate the risk of my prior work on YouTube being undiscoverable due to shifting policies.
- On a batch of 234 videos, the program crashed on attempting to download deleted or invalid media.
- I patched Tubeup to alleviate the issue, then I submitted my changes via a pull request on the official project page.
- Unlike most other projects to which I contributed, the author quickly accepted my changes.
