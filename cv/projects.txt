- During the Covid lockdowns, I engineered a mobile web app to revive buffets whilst minimising inflection risk.
- This project's user-interaction model drew inspiration from how some Korean barbecue establishments operate:
  - Where dine-in customers can order food directly from a website they can access from their phones.
